								GitHub Class Tips
1- Create new repository in github.com --> click on New repository --> Provision name: DemoRestAssured --> click on Create 
   Now we have an empty repository in github.com and we can send codes from our local machine into it so that others can 
   use it.
2- going to my local machine: first I have to let github.com which is the userId/email that I will be using to push/pull the code. We
